This is an Arduino based garage watcher. It is capable of telling if the garage is open or not via a switch. The temperature via a DS18S20. It can also tell if you left the light on via an LDR. A Shield PCB is in the works and will be available soon. This also uses the Neuelectronics ethernet shield but a nanode would also work without much effort.
