This is an Arduino based garage watcher. It is cpable of telling ifd the garage is open or not via a switch. The temperature via a DS18S20. It can also tell if you left the light on via an LDR. A Shield PCB is in the works and will be available on BatchPCB marketplace. This also uses the Neuelectronics ethernet shield but I think a nanode would also work without much effort.
